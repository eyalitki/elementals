Welcome to elementals's documentation!
======================================

Brief
-----
The **elementals** python package is a utility package with handy tools for CTF scripts and PoC-style scripts. What was first implemented for personal use in small research scripts was now upgraded to be used by security researchers as a lightweight substitute to the famous pwntools package.

``pip install elementals``

The features included in **elementals** are:

* **Logger:** Basic (logging based) logger - configured and ready to use 
* **Prompter:** Metasploit based stdout wrapper for the logger
* **ProgressBar:** User-friendly graphical progress bar
* **StatusBar:** User-friendly graphical status bar
* **createAnchor:** Creates a time-stamped output directory for all script outputs
* **hexDump:** Stylized hex dump for binary blobs / strings
